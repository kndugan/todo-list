# ToDo List

## Description

In this project, I've create a simple todo list for a vacation to capture tasks. The user can add todos with a form or remove todos by clicking on the item they'd like to remove.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

To run this program, simply open the index.html file in your browswer and add or remove todos as desired.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include creating the option for user input for Todo List name to fully customize for the client.
