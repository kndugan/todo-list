# ToDo List

This project was bootstrapped with [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

In this project, I've used React to create a simple todo list for a vacation to capture tasks. The user can add todos with a form or remove todos by clicking on the tasks.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

Open the project in VS Code and [Open with Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Runs the app in the development mode so the user can view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include creating a full React app to run the app.
